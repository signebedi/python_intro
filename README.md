# Course Curriculum

All resources and problem sets are optional unless marked as *(required)*. Before the first week in class, please fill out the survey at *** placeholder to facilitate the creation of study groups constituting a mix of student backgrounds, experiences, and areas of study. Lecture Notes will generally come in two formats: markdown slides and Jupyter Notebooks. You can read the markdown slides directly in GitHub, where each horizontal rule separates two slides (see [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a quick markdown reference). Likewise, you can review Jupyter Notebooks from within GitHub (but, if you're having difficulty viewing them, you can paste the link to the page [here](https://nbviewer.org/) and it should render properly) as well as in VSCode (when you are running the [Jupyter Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks). We will spend the first class discussing how to make effective use of Lecture Notes and the Curriculum below.

In addition to Lecture Notes, I will generally post digital Problem Sets and Resources - again, all of these are optional unless marked as *(required)*. Problem Sets will, in all cases, be written as Jupyter Notebooks. You should be able to read these in the browser, using Jupyter through your Anaconda Python installation, and/or in VSCode using the Jupyter plugin. These are written in such a way that you should be able to fill in your answers at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook. Resources are a collection of reference material that may be useful to you when internalizing some of the concepts we are discussion in class. 

One of the great things about programming is that there are a variety of ways to solve the same problem. Notwithstanding some solutions are more 'efficient' or 'paradigmatic' than others, the difference very often comes down to readability, simplicity, and intuitiveness. Often, my model solutions to our problem sets will fall short of the very best (read: efficient, paradigmatic) way to write the solution - because my goal in this class is to provide solutions that will be the most intellectually accessible, syntactically clear, and generally applicable for participants that may not have a computer science background. As such, I am not asking you to provide 'perfect' solutions, and indeed will often provide imperfect solutions myself, instead placing a premium on 'working code' that 'gets the job done'.

Python has an extensive community of developers and users. As a result, there is a substantial discourse over paradigms, conventions, and syntactical change. These are published in the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), which can be found [online](https://peps.python.org/#) and are a good resource on the language, along with Stack Overview, Real Python, and W3Schools.
